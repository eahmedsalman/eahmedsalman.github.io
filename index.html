<h1>My GSOC </h1>
<h2>My experience with TL_verilog generic library porject </h2>
<p>My first experience working on bleeding-edge technology was beneficial in all sides
working on great projects with a great mentor @Steve Hoover ,Updating the library
syntax of an emerging language extension to System Verilog Transaction-Level
Verilog (TL-Verilog).<br><br>
The library contains FIFOs, arbiters, etc. and updating a flow example demonstrating
the power of TL-Verilog creating complex designs with just a few lines of code.
Working on bleeding-edge technology, Lack of full documentation was a challenge, but
with Steve being always there for mentoring and guidance I was able to work through
this challenge.<br><br>
Now I am working on expanding the library with Xilinx macros and modules to utilize the
FBGA resources by making interface for modules like block ram and DSP in TL-Verilog.</p>
